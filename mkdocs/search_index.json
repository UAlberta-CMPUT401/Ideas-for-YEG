Reddit is a site where content can be voted on and viewed, so many of its features parallel that of the proposed site.\n\n\nKickstarter\n\n\nKickstarter is a site where users can donate various amounts of money to projects. This feature may be something we want to keep our eye on, as Kickstarter may have a smart system of handling donations and project funding. One feature is that funding can be withheld if a minimum donation threshold is not met. \n\n\n\n\nSimilar Open Source Projects\n\n\nReddit: Slide for reddit\n\n\nSlide for reddit is an open sourced and ad free Reddit browser for Android. Some aspects of the eventual user interface and features of #ideas4YEG align with those of slide for reddit. \n\n\n\n\nContributors\n\n\n\n\nContributed By Christian Lo, Colin Kushniruk, Monica Bui, Rehab El-Hajj\n\n\nJan 26 2020",
