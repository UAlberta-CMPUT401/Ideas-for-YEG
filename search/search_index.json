Reddit is a site where content can be voted on and viewed, so many of its features parallel that of the proposed site. Kickstarter Kickstarter is a site where users can donate various amounts of money to projects. This feature may be something we want to keep our eye on, as Kickstarter may have a smart system of handling donations and project funding. One feature is that funding can be withheld if a minimum donation threshold is not met.
