# Project Overview
By the words of the client, Ideas for YEG is a project with the goal of connecting developers/tinkerers/students with interesting project ideas born from their own community. Ideas for YEG will bring these people together to generate ideas to improve their community/city which can be upvoted, donated to and volunteered for. The system is to be a mobile-friendly open-source project that can be used by any community to host their own fork for themselves.

Reddit will be a heavy source of inspiration for many features, as its UI is simple and likely has solved a lot of UX issues that the site previously had years before. Reddit is a site where content can be voted on and viewed, so many of its features parallel that of the proposed site.

## [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/)
Kickstarter is a site where users can donate various amounts of money to projects. This feature may be something we want to keep our eye on, as Kickstarter may have a smart system of handling donations and project funding. One feature is that funding can be withheld if a minimum donation threshold is not met.
