# Project Overview
By the words of the client, Ideas for YEG is a project with the goal of connecting developers/tinkerers/students with interesting project ideas born from their own community. Ideas for YEG will bring these people together to generate ideas to improve their community/city which can be upvoted, donated to and volunteered for. The system is to be a mobile-friendly open-source project that can be used by any community to host their own fork for themselves.

# Project Management Document
The team is split half way, with half of our team focusing primarily on back-end work (Csaba, Colin, Louis) and half our team focusing primarily on front-end work (Monica, Rehab, Christian). 

We created a GANTT chart outlining the tasks for each sprint and assignees. The blue tasks are back-end tasks, the red tasks are front-end tasks, and grey tasks are either documentation (most of sprint 1) or un-assigned tasks (sprint 3 and 4).

# Use Cases or User Stories
[With Reference to Eugene Chenâ€™s 401 ideas4.co Dev Details Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d1UYda6Yri3o0E0bkZSC-bgtwTXizyNDOPyZJkbL7w4/edit?usp=sharing), user story
and feature requrirements have been extracted from this file and been extended further to meet the overall goal of the project.

The user stories were chosen to meet the requirements because our client has outlined these before our first meeting. As a team, we then modified the stories to help better understand the overall goal we were going for and as well added additional ones to tackle some of the details not mentioned in the details document.
